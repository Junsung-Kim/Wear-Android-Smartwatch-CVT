Wear - Android Smartwatch sensor data CVT
=============
CVT: collection and visualization tool

## Android smartwatch sensor data collection and visualization tool. - Wear Part

If you are looking for a tool to see the sensor values from the Android Smartwatch in graph form,
I recommend using this project on the Wear-side and the [PC-side project](https://github.com/Junsung-Kim/PC-Android-Smartwatch-CVT "PC-side project").
